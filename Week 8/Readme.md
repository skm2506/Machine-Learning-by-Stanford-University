## Unsupervised Learning
###
We use unsupervised learning to build models that help us understand our data better. We discuss the k-Means algorithm for clustering that enable us to learn groupings of
unlabeled data points.
###

## Dimensionality Reduction
###
In this module, we introduce Principal Components Analysis, and show how it can be used for data compression to speed up learning algorithms as well as for visualizations of
complex datasets.
